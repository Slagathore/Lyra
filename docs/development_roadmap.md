# Lyra Development Roadmap

This document outlines the key development priorities for the Lyra system, organized by component and timeline. This helps ensure we're focusing on the most important enhancements that will deliver the most value.

## Current Status

Lyra has transitioned from a service-based architecture to a more user-friendly system tray application. The system is currently comprised of these major components:

- **Core System**: Central orchestration through `lyra_core.py`
- **Cognitive Architecture**: Integration of metacognition, emotional processing, and memory
- **Media Generation**: Unified interface for generating images, audio, and video
- **UI Components**: Web interface, telegram bot, voice interface
- **System Tray**: Background operation with quick access to features

## Short-Term Priorities (Next 30 Days)

### 1. Stability & Reliability

- ✅ Complete transition from service-based to tray-based architecture
- ⬜ Add comprehensive exception handling throughout the codebase
- ⬜ Create automatic state preservation and recovery mechanisms
- ⬜ Implement health monitoring and self-diagnostics

### 2. Core Functionality

- ✅ Refine core architecture to eliminate redundant components
- ⬜ Optimize message processing pipeline for better responsiveness
- ⬜ Implement background knowledge loading and caching
- ⬜ Add support for model quantization options

### 3. UI/UX Improvements

- ⬜ Create a streamlined setup wizard for first-time users
- ⬜ Improve media tab with gallery view and organization tools
- ⬜ Add theme customization options
- ⬜ Implement accessibility improvements

### 4. Development Tools

- ⬜ Create comprehensive test suite for core components
- ⬜ Add performance benchmarking tools
- ⬜ Implement automated documentation generation
- ⬜ Create module development templates

## Medium-Term Goals (1-3 Months)

### 1. Enhanced Cognitive Capabilities

- ⬜ Implement iterative reasoning using verifiers
- ⬜ Develop more sophisticated emotional response modeling
- ⬜ Add concept mapping visualization
- ⬜ Create deeper integration between memory and metacognition

### 2. Multimodal Improvements

- ⬜ Support for commercial multimodal models (GPT-4V, Claude 3, etc.)
- ⬜ Add video understanding capabilities
- ⬜ Implement multi-step workflows (e.g., image generation → editing → enhancement)
- ⬜ Support for real-time audio transcription

### 3. Extensibility

- ⬜ Create plugin architecture for third-party extensions
- ⬜ Implement standard API endpoints for external applications
- ⬜ Develop extension marketplace concept
- ⬜ Add tools interface for web searching, calculation, etc.

### 4. UI Expansion

- ⬜ Develop mobile companion app
- ⬜ Create dashboard for system insights
- ⬜ Add support for custom UI layouts
- ⬜ Implement conversation templates/starters

## Long-Term Vision (3+ Months)

### 1. Advanced Cognitive Architecture

- ⬜ Implement hierarchical cognitive architecture with specialized subsystems
- ⬜ Develop sophisticated conceptual reasoning capabilities
- ⬜ Create more human-like memory with forgetting curves and associative recall
- ⬜ Implement theory of mind modeling

### 2. Multidevice & Ecosystem

- ⬜ Develop synchronized experience across devices
- ⬜ Create cloud-optional architecture for larger memory and processing capability
- ⬜ Support for voice assistants and smart home integration
- ⬜ Implement secure multi-user support

### 3. Knowledge & Learning

- ⬜ Create personalized knowledge graph that evolves with use
- ⬜ Implement continuous learning from interactions
- ⬜ Develop domain-specific specialization capabilities
- ⬜ Add structured knowledge integration from various sources

### 4. Creative Tools

- ⬜ Support for collaborative creation
- ⬜ Develop integrated creative workflows
- ⬜ Implement project management capabilities
- ⬜ Add support for long-form content creation

## Project Management
