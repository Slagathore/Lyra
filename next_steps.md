# Next Steps for Using Your Qwen Model

Congratulations on setting up your Qwen 2.5 model with CUDA acceleration! Now that everything is working, here are some options for what you can do next:

## 1. Run the Model Directly

Use the `run_model.bat` script to start a simple chat interface that runs directly in the console. This is the most basic way to interact with your model.

## 2. Use the REST API Server

Run `run_rest_server.bat` to start an OpenAI-compatible API server that you can use to:
- Integrate with other applications
- Build your own web interface
- Use with existing AI tools that support the OpenAI API

Once running, the API will be available at: `http://localhost:8000/v1`

Example Python code to use the API:

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    base_url="http://localhost:8000/v1",
    api_key="no-key-needed"  # any value works
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="qwen",  # model name doesn't matter for the server
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Write a short poem about artificial intelligence."}
    ],
    temperature=0.7,
    max_tokens=500
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

## 3. Use with Oobabooga Text Generation Web UI

The Oobabooga interface offers a user-friendly web UI for interacting with your model, along with:
- Chat memory and conversation history
- Parameter adjustment
- Various output formats
- Extensions for different capabilities

Run `G:\AI\Lyra\oobabooga\run_qwen_cuda.bat` to start the web interface.

## 4. Advanced: Fine-tune the Model

If you want to customize the model for specific tasks:
- Look into LoRA fine-tuning using libraries like [axolotl](https://github.com/axolotl-org/axolotl)
- Merge smaller LoRA adaptations into your model to improve performance on specific tasks

## 5. Performance Optimization

If you want to squeeze more performance out of your system:
- Adjust `n_gpu_layers` based on your GPU memory (higher = more GPU usage, faster inference)
- Experiment with `n_batch` size (128-1024) to find the optimal value for your setup
- Try different quantized models (Q4_K_M, Q5_K_M, etc.) to balance quality and speed

## 6. Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check CUDA support: Run `python check_llama_cpp_installation.py`
2. Memory issues: Reduce the number of GPU layers with `--n_gpu_layers` parameter
3. Slow inference: Ensure you're using GPU acceleration properly
4. Model loading errors: Verify the model path is correct

## 7. Explore More Models

Now that you have the infrastructure set up, you can download and try other models:
- Visit [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co) for thousands of models
- Look for GGUF format models that are optimized for llama-cpp-python
- Smaller models might run faster on your system
