# llama-cpp-python Version Compatibility Guide

## Qwen2 Model Compatibility

Your Qwen2.5-QwQ-35B model has the architecture identifier `qwen2` which requires a specific version of llama-cpp-python to work.

### Compatible Versions

For Qwen2 architecture support, you need:
- llama-cpp-python version 0.2.37 or newer

### Current Compatibility Issues

Based on the error logs, your current version (0.2.26+cu118) does **not** support the Qwen2 architecture. The error message "unknown model architecture: 'qwen2'" indicates this limitation.

### Solutions

1. **Upgrade llama-cpp-python**: 
   ```
   pip install --prefer-binary --extra-index-url https://jllllll.github.io/llama-cpp-python-cuBLAS-wheels/AVX2/cu118 llama-cpp-python==0.2.37+cu118
   ```

2. **Use a different model**:
   - Run `run_other_model.bat` to download and use a Mistral model which is compatible with your current version

3. **Use oobabooga Text Generation WebUI**:
   - This UI supports a wider range of models including Qwen2

## Other Available Models

These models should work with older versions of llama-cpp-python:

1. **Mistral 7B**: General purpose instruct model
   - Architecture: Mistral
   - Size: ~4GB
   - Compatible with most llama-cpp-python versions

2. **Llama 2 7B**: Meta's open model
   - Architecture: Llama
   - Size: ~4GB
   - Compatible with most llama-cpp-python versions

## Checking Model Architecture

To check a model's architecture:
```python
import llama_cpp
metadata = llama_cpp.get_model_metadata("path/to/your/model.gguf")
architecture = metadata.get("general.architecture", "")
print(f"Model architecture: {architecture}")
```

## Server Functionality

Yes, the server would work if you had a compatible model! You can:
1. Update llama-cpp-python to support Qwen2
2. Use a different model with your current version
